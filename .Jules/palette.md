## 2026-02-14 - Standardizing Form Feedback and Accessibility
**Learning:** The contact form lacked clear visual indicators for mandatory fields and lacked immediate visual feedback during submission beyond text changes. Standardizing these (asterisks, legends, aria-describedby, and spinners) improves both accessibility and user confidence.
**Action:** Apply the asterisk/legend pattern for required fields and add a loading spinner to all async action buttons in future components.
